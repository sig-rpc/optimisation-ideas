# Optimisation Ideas

This repo exists to collect simple optimisation tips within the GitHub issues. It's not currently clear how we'll incorporate these (e.g. within our own website in a common format, or linking to 3rd party resources). But collecting them here gives us a good foundation for when we decide to take on any particular topic.

## How To

If you come across any optimisations that seem appropriate. Find or create an issue for the relevant topic and leave a comment. The more detail the better, but if you only have a link to a social media post that's fine too. Maybe include a screenshot, if there's a risk of the URL becoming 404.

Thanks!
